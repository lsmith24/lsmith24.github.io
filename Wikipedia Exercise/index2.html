            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>
            Coraline Jones and her parents move into an old mansion that has been divided up into flats. Her parents struggle to complete 
            their gardening catalog, so Coraline is often neglected. She meets the landlady's grandson, Wyborne "Wybie", Lovat and a black 
            cat who follows him around. Wybie later leaves Coraline a button-eyed rag doll he discovered in his grandmother's trunk that 
            eerily resembles her. Soon after, Coraline discovers a small door in the living room that is bricked up, but can be unlocked 
            with a key that has a button-shaped motif.
            </p>
            <p>
            That night, Coraline is awoken by a mouse, who guides her through the door to a seemingly livelier version of the house. 
            Coraline meets her Other Mother and Other Father, button-eyed doppelg√§ngers of her parents who seem more attentive and caring. 
            After having dinner with them, Coraline goes to bed and awakens back in the real world. Wybie tells Coraline about his 
            grandmother's twin sister who disappeared as a child. Coraline's neighbors, Sergei Alexander Bobinsky, an eccentric gymnast 
            who owns a mouse circus, and retired burlesque actresses April Spink and Miriam Forcible, cryptically warn her about the door 
            and of imminent danger.
            </p>
            <p>
            Coraline visits the Other World for a second and third time. Accompanied by the mute Other Wybie, she is entertained by the 
            Other Bobinsky's mouse circus and the Other Spink and Other Forcible. Coraline also encounters the cat, who is able to speak 
            in the Other World. The Other Mother tells Coraline she stay there permanently, but only if she has buttons sewn over her eyes. 
            Horrified, Coraline rejects the offer and quickly goes to bed. In the morning, however, Coraline finds herself still in the 
            Other World. When she demands to return home, the Other Mother transforms into a more menacing version of herself and imprisons 
            Coraline in a room behind a mirror. There, she meets the ghosts of the Other Mother's child victims, including Wybie's great aunt. 
            They reveal that the Other Mother, whom they call the "Beldam", used the same doll Coraline had to spy on them to use their unhappiness 
            to lure them into her world. When they accepted the Beldam's offer of having buttons sewn over their eyes, she trapped their souls. 
            After Coraline promises to free them, the Other Wybie helps her escape back to the real world.

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
            The soundtrack for Coraline features songs composed by French composer Bruno Coulais, with one ("Other Father Song") by They Might Be 
            Giants. The Other Father's singing voice is provided by John Linnell, one of the singers from the band. They had initially written 10 
            songs for the film; when a melancholy tone was decided, all but one were cut. Coulais' score was performed by the Hungarian Symphony 
            Orchestra and features choral pieces sung by the Children's Choir of Nice in a nonsense language. Selick mentions that the main soloist, 
            "a young girl you hear singing in several parts of the film," is coincidentally named Coraline. Coraline won Coulais the 2009 Annie 
            Award for best score for an animated feature.
