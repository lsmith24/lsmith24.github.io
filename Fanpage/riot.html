			<p>The Riot Grrrl movement consisted of networks of young women who worked to challenge male hegemony within the punk scene and in society in general. The Riot Grrrls began in the early 1990s by Washington State band, Bikini Kill, and lead singer Kathleen Hanna. Throughout the history of the punk scene, many women took on this challenge, but the Riot Grrrls were the first group to organize and hold women-only meetings in which they would discussed the ways sexism controlled their everyday lives.</p>
