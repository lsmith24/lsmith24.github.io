                                <p>The first step to creating any makeup looking is making sure our skin
                                is clean and moisturized. Start with clean, dry skin and then apply your favorite
                            	moisturized to your face. We also want to prime our skin by taking any primer you like and applying that evenly over our face as well.</p>

                                <h1>Step 2: Brows</h1>
                                <p>The next thing I like to do after preparing my face is my eyebrows. This may seem a little unconventional,
                                but I think having your brows set is a quick and easy thing to start off with. I use the Benefit clear brow gel,
                            	but if you prefer a tinted brow gel that works great too. I apply the gel to both my eyebrows and simply shape them
                            	with a spoolie (eyebrow brush). If you prefer to fill in your brows a bit more you can do that before setting them with gel. I am also going to add a little touch of loose glitter over the gel so that it sticks to my brows. I'm using a small silver glitter, but feel free to tweak this to be more or less bold depending on your style.</p>

                                <h1>Step 3: Eyeshadow</h1>
                                <p>I am using cream/liquid eye paints for both my eyeshadow and my eyeliner. First I take a pink shade and apply it all over my lid, as well as a bit above my lid toward my eyebrows. I blend that out with my finger so that I have a light pink effect all around my eye area. Then I take a blue shade and apply that just over my lid. This is going to be the base color for the glitter shadow. I blend this blue out, and then take my glitter eye paint and apply that over my lid as well. I do not blend this one out as much because I really want the glitter to be concentrated just on my lid.</p>

                                <p>Although I am using the same product as I did for my eyeshadow, I am going to use a very thin brush here to get the eyeliner effect. First I take my pink color and run that along my bottom waterline, so there should be a subtle amount of pink underneath my eyes. Next I take that same pink color and start to draw the outline of a flame around the outside of my lid. I draw a line above my lid, so when my eyes are open this should not be in the crease. I then drag it out towards the outer corner of my eye and drame some flames. You can really make this any shape you like! I connect the end of the flame back to the outer corner of my eye. Then I fill this in with pink up to where the glitter shadow starts. I also then took my original blue color and drew a line of eyeliner just along my lash line, where eyeliner would generally go.</p>

                                <h1>Step 5: Concealer + Foundation</h1>
                                <p>I personally have super dark bags under my eyes, so the first thing I always do here is apply concealer to my under-eyes. I blend this out using a slightly damp makeup sponge. I also apply concealer to any other blemishes or spots on my face that are looking particularly red. I then take a powder foundation and lightly apply it over the concealer and around the rest of my face. I will sometimes use a liquid foundation here, but today I do not want a heavy amount of product on my skin. If you prefer liquid foundation of course feel free to use that instead though! After my foundation is done I generally go back in with a slightly darker concealer and just make sure that everything looks how I want it to. I then apply a setting powder with a large brush, primarily under my eyes, but lightly across my whole face. This will keep our makeup from creasing or getting too oily.</p>

                                <h1>Step 6: Blush + Bronzer</h1>
                                <p>For this step I first take a contour brush with some powder bronzer and apply it
                                underneath my cheekbones. This will give a more defined look to our cheekbones and emphasize the highlighter we will do in the next step very well. Make sure to blend this out so that it look natural. I then take a slightly smaller brush and do the same thing along the sides of my nose. If you want even more definition you can do the same thing along your jawline and top/sides of your forehead as well. Next I take a large brush with some powder blush and apply that in an upward fashion on my cheekbones. I blend this out, dragging some of the blush down and across my nose as well. That part is optional, if you prefer to keep your blush only on your cheekbones that is perfectly fine! Make sure everything is blended evenly before moving on to the highlighter step.</p>

                                <p>Here I take my liquid highlighter and apply a small amount to my cheekbones
                                as well as the top of my nose. I blend this out so that it is even and fits naturally with the rest of my face makeup. I also like to add a touch of highlighter
                            	to the inner corners of my eyes, as well as at the peak of my brow bone underneath my eyebrows.</p>

                                <p>The only thing I do for my lips is apply a sheer red lipgloss! If you prefer to line your lips or use a lipstick instead of gloss that works great too. I like to keep a more subtle lip here because we want the main focus to be our eye makeup. (In the photos I do this after adding some things I mention in the final step, but I think it makes more sense to do lips before that).</p>

                                <p>Lastly, I apply my mascara, which is just a plain black color, and I brush
                                it out with an eyelash brush. I also added a couple stick on sparkles, as well as some glitter in my hair just to tie it all together. Feel free to add any other finishing touches you like
                            	at this step! The very last thing I do is apply a setting spray evenly over my face
                            	so that the look will stay intact for the rest of the day.</p>
