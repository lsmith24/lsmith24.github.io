		<p>This project seeks to explore my own relationship with technology and social media. Over the course of four days I 
		tracked how many times I opened my phone, and the percentage of those times that I ended up on social media, or generally distracted
		from the original reason that I opened my phone. For example, if I opened my phone to answer a text, but then ended up going on Instagram
		I would count that as a time I got distracted. I utilized the "pick ups" number in the screen time feature of my phone to get an accurate
		number of how many times I opened my phone. In order to get the data on how many times I got distracted I simply had to recognize that I
		 had done so. You can explore my data by clicking the button below.</p>
